# 🌾 GrainPalette – A Deep Learning Odyssey in Rice Type Classification Through Transfer Learning

GrainPalette is a deep learning-based web application that classifies different types of rice grains using a transfer learning model (MobileNetV2). This solution automates rice quality detection and classification using image recognition, supporting farmers, food processing units, and distributors.

Testing
Model trained for 5 epochs with over 99% accuracy

Manual testing of all five rice types

Performance validated with validation split and confusion matrix

🔐 Authentication
No user login for this version. Future versions can include user authentication using Flask sessions or JWT.

🧾 API Overview
Endpoint	Method	Description
/	GET	Loads home page
/predict	POST	Accepts image & returns result

🖼️ Sample UI

(Replace with actual image if needed)

🚧 Known Issues
Some rice types may be misclassified if image quality is poor

Works best with clear, zoomed-in images on white background

🔮 Future Enhancements
Add more rice types to classification

Deploy on cloud (Render, Heroku, or AWS)

Add authentication and user profile history

Build as PWA (Progressive Web App)
